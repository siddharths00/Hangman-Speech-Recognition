# Hangman-Speech-Recognition

This was a very fun experiment that I came up with while studying about NLTK(Natural Language ToolKit) and how it's used in the field of Machine Learning. 
Almost every single one of us is aware of the [Hangman Game](https://www.considerable.com/entertainment/games/hangman/). Many versions of the game exist with implementations in python. This particular script is no exception, it is still, at its core, a hangman game... But with a twist!

In this game you'll have to guess the phrase provided, not by typing, but by _**speaking**_!.

Find yourself a quiet room and run this script locally. It wouldn't work on Google Colab since the script requires access to your microphone and there's no microphone attached to the virtual machine which executes Python code in Colab. 

Take a look at the ipython notebook provided in the repository. Read it thoroughly and you'll understand how the game is supposed to work.
